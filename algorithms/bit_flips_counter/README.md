# Bit Flips Counter

Outputs the number of bit flips necessary to convert a number N from N-1.

For example, 11 (0b1011) to 12 (0b1100) requires flipping 3 bits.

For a given number n, the list of required bit flips from each of its previous number is printed.
For example, given n=12, the following would be printed.

1: 1  
2: 2  
3: 1  
4: 3  
5: 1  
6: 2  
7: 1  
8: 4  
9: 1  
10: 2  
11: 1  
12: 3  

## Usage
Run any of the programs with a Python interpreter, giving a positive integer (n > 0) as an argument.
